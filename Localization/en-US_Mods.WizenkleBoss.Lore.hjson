	Day 1: Discovery of Anomaly (Starname)
	Entry 001: Dr. Zoe, Lead Astrophysicist

	    Originally, we were observing the weird force surrounding the star, but this is more than that. This star is different from the others. I dont know if this is a lead, but we need to investigate more. I feel we are on the verge of discovery. The moment we first observed the anomaly around (starname). The star was flickering in patterns that were unlike anything ever seen. 
	I've sent our findings to the research team, but the patterns don't fit any known cosmic frequency. The radiation seems more... orderly? As if intentionally organized, as if waiting for us to find it. Whatever is happening on (starname), it is not just a fluke of events. It feels like we're being watched.
